# Card Came
This is a proposed solution for Assignment 4 for students learning html and javascript.

## To start the project locally
1. Run 'yarn' which will install dependencies.
2. Run 'node server.js' in order to spin up a server.
3. Visit 'localhost:3000'

Note: Make sure you're not running anything on port 3000 as this script does not check for conflicts or try to resolve them in any way. It's just a simple, quick & dirty express spinup after all.
